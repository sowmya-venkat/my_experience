# My Experience
The exercise assigned to me has been a unique experience. It enabled me to step into the world of Dockers. Though I have been working on Cloud-native projects, I did not have a direct experience of deployment. What was more gratifying was that I had the hands-on experience to understand dockers, install the Docker desktop, and through PowerShell as the interface, I was able to develop a sample application with the help of the instructions. I have successfully used GitHub pages to publish a Markdown file.
